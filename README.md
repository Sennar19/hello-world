# hello-world
Me, and my interests

I’m 27 years old, I’m graduated to the "Astronomia e Astrofisica" course at the "La Sapienza" University of Rome, and I’m specialized on dynamics of stellar systems. I’m an extrovert guy, I like to work in team (more brains are better than one!), and I’m always ready to test and improve my own skills, overcoming my limits.
